Knowledge Store

 Purpose: We want to provide the readers to get the access to the books they want to read on rent for a numbers of days at affordable rental prices and security deposit, out of that security deposit will be returned to the user once they return the book in the condition they got the book in first place. It will solve two problems for readers which are 

 i) Purchasing every book they want to read at regular intervals.
 ii) Problem of storing the books at their home

  Kindly note: We're not talking about academics books on our platform. We're talking about Self-Help books, Finance books, Business books, Skill related books, Biography books, and Ficitional books.  

 Our platform will allow readers to rent a book for a period of time and return the book after they read it successfully and now they don't have to think about the issue of where should I keep this book.

 Our platforms is specifically for those who read books or want to start their journey of reading books.
